# SharePoint Server 2019 Flow Extension

This is a _simple_ solution that provides a button for Flow in Document Libraries and Lists. It can be used to raise awareness that Flow is avaiable for your users.

The releases section has a packaged version which you can upload to your SharePoint farm App Catalog. After adding it to the App Catalog, you can install the share-point-2019-flow-command-client-side-solution from the Organization apps. There is no further configuration required.
